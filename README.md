Welcome to the **Advanced Video Stabilization and ROI Pixel Analysis** repository! This project was developed as part of the Digital Forensics course during my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Catania. The goal of this project is to enhance video quality and perform pixel analysis on regions of interest (ROI) using Python.

## Project Overview

Video stabilization aims to reduce unwanted camera motion in videos. This project implements algorithms to achieve this stabilization while allowing for pixel analysis in specific regions. It utilizes popular libraries like OpenCV and NumPy to process video frames effectively.

## Features

- **Video Stabilization**: Smooth out shaky footage using advanced algorithms.
- **ROI Pixel Analysis**: Analyze pixel data in specified regions of interest.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple commands to load videos and perform analysis.
- **Detailed Logging**: Keep track of processing steps and results.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear instructions for setup and usage.

## Technologies Used

This project employs a variety of technologies and tools:

- **Python**: The main programming language for development.
- **OpenCV**: A library for computer vision tasks.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array manipulations.
- **Markdown**: For documentation formatting.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.
- **HTML**: For potential web-based interfaces in future updates.
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Implemented to optimize performance.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gitluffywd/Advanced_Video_Stabilization_and_ROI_Pixel_Analysis.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Advanced_Video_Stabilization_and_ROI_Pixel_Analysis
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download Releases**: For the latest release, visit [here](https://github.com/gitluffywd/Advanced_Video_Stabilization_and_ROI_Pixel_Analysis/releases) to download the necessary files.

## Usage

Once you have installed the project, you can use it as follows:

1. **Load a Video**:
   Run the main script and specify the video file:
   ```bash
   python main.py --video path_to_your_video.mp4
   ```

2. **Specify ROI**:
   You can define regions of interest using coordinates. For example:
   ```bash
   python main.py --video path_to_your_video.mp4 --roi x1,y1,x2,y2
   ```

3. **View Results**:
   The processed video will be saved in the output directory, and you can view logs for pixel analysis.
